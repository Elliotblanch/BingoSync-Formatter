Script requires Python to run

Outputs a text file in a JSON format, to be able to create custom bingo boards for bingosync from a large pool of options

Input each possible bingo square in the .txt file as a new line, then run BingoScript.py. You can input as many as you want, the script will still only pick 25.

Repeat entries are filtered out.

If you want to run the script for a separate text file, simply replace 'eldenRingo.txt' with the name of the file you wish to use.

The results will be stored in output.json rady to be copied into BingoSync.

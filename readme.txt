Script requires Python to run

Outputs a text file in a JSON format, to be able to create custom bingo boards for bingosync from a large pool of options

Input each possible bingo square in the .txt file as a new line, then run BingoScript.py

If you want to run the script for a separate text file, simple replace 'eldenRingo.txt' with the name of the file you wish to use

The results will be stored in output.json rady to be xopied into BingoSync
